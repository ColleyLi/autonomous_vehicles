\chapter{Model Based Engineering}
\label{model_based_eng}
In this chapter we will introduce the Reinforcement Learning, or RL for short, paradigm. Concretely, we will try to cover the fundamental points of the RL paradigm. This chapter will touch upon the following topics



\section{Feedback Systems}
What is a feedback system?


\subsection{Feedback Principles}
Let's quickly summarize some important feedback principles


\begin{itemize}

\item Control objectives that is specifications. We may have qualitative or quantitative objectives.
\item Derivation of the mathematical model describing the system or the component we work on
\item Design the controller
\item Analyze the performance
\end{itemize}
