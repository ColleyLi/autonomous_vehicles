One of the principal uses of observers in practice is to estimate the state of a
system in the presence of noisy measurements. We have not yet treated noise in our
analysis, and a full treatment of stochastic dynamical systems is beyond the scope
of this text. In this section, we present a brief introduction to the use of stochastic
systems analysis for constructing observers. We work primarily in discrete time to
avoid some of the complications associated with continuous-time random processes
and to keep the mathematical prerequisites to a minimum. This section assumes
basic knowledge of random variables and stochastic processes; see Kumar and
Varaiya [KV86] or Åström [Åst06] for the required material.
