\section{The Naive Bayes algorithm}
\label{naive_bayes_algo}

Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable.

\begin{remark}{\textbf{Baye's Theorem}}

Bayes’ theorem states the following relationship, given class variable $y$ and dependent feature vector 
$x_1$ through $x_n$

\begin{equation}
P(y | x_1, \ldots , x_n ) = \frac{P(y)P(x_1, \ldots, x_n|y)}{P(x_1, \ldots, x_n)}
\end{equation}
