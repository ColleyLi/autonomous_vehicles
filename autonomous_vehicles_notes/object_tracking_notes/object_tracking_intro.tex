\subsection{Single Object Tracking}

Single object tracking is essentially a filtering problem. We are dealing with sequential processing of a noisy
sensor measurements in order to determine the state of the object.

\begin{remark}{}

When we say state we actually mean the position of the object together with properties that describe
its motion e.g. speed and direction
\end{remark}
\end{framed}

The filtering problem is not so easy to solve since the state of the object is neither fully not directly observed.

\begin{definition}{\textbf{Multiple Object Tracking (MOT)}}

Multiple Object Tracking is defined as the sequentioal processing of noisy sensor measurements in order to determine
the number of dynamic objects in each dynamic state of the object.  
\end{definition}
\end{framed}


Typically MOT is based on sensor detections. common sensors in MOT are

\begin{itemize}
\item Cameras
\item Radars
\item LiDARs
\end{itemize}

In addition, the sensor data serves as input to a detector. The block diagram in Figure \ref{sensor_mot_block_diagram} illustrates the concept.
