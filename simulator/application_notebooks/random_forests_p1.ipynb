    "Random forest is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm based on what is known as ensemble learning. Ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. Unlike a statistical ensemble in statistical mechanics, which is usually infinite, a machine learning ensemble consists of only a concrete finite set of alternative models, but typically allows for much more flexible structure to exist among those alternatives.  The random forest algorithm combines multiple decision trees, resulting in a forest of trees, and thus the name Random Forest. The  algorithm can be used both for regression and classification tasks."

    "1. The random forest algorithm is not biased, since, there are multiple trees and each tree is trained on a subset of data. Basically, the random forest algorithm relies on the power of \"the crowd\"; therefore the overall biasedness of the algorithm is reduced.\n",
    "2. The algorithm is very stable. Even if a new data point is introduced in the dataset the overall algorithm is not affected much since new data may impact one tree, but it is very hard for it to impact all the trees.\n",
    "3. The random forest algorithm works well when you have both categorical and numerical features.\n",
    "4. The random forest algorithm also works well when data has missing values or it has not been scaled well (although we have performed feature scaling in this article just for the purpose of demonstration).\n"
